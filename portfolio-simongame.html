        <p>When making this game, there were a few things that I intended to learn from the experience. I wanted to learn how to effectively use event listeners to make the game interactive, make use of variables to keep a score, use a loop to keep the game going and restart the game when one doesn't succeed, better my commenting skills, and finally make use of jQuery to shorten my code.</p>

        <p>I enjoyed this project as it felt like making a real game that becomes more and more challenging. I saw how a fraction of an old framework can save so much time and effort.</p>
